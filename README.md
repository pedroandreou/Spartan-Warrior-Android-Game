## 📰 Description
The main idea of my game is based on Greek mythology. The hero of my game is a Spartan warrior whose mission is to reach as many levels as his can. This can happen only by having in his possession a key which will be used to open the door for reaching the next level. However, the way to glory will not be that easy as hazards will appear through his way and if he touches any of them, he will firstly lose health and then dies with the game terminating. For each soup that he collects, we can hear him eating and the health increases. The game has got many sounds and background music which catch the player’s attention and enhance user experience
